This time, I designed a restaurant menu with an Indian theme, showcasing a variety of delicious options from North Indian meals to South Indian specialties, Tiffins, and sweet treats.
 A restaurant menu UI/UX project is the process of designing a menu that is
 both visually appealing and easy to use. The goal of a good restaurant menu
 is to make it easy for customers to find the dishes they want, and to
 encourage them to order more.
 A good restaurant menu should be:
 Visually appealing: The menu should be visually appealing and easy to read. The use of
 colors, fonts, and images should be carefully considered to create a visually appealing
 menu.
 Easy to use: The menu should be easy to use and navigate. The customer should be able to
 easily find the necessary information and make their selections.
 Categorized: The menu should be categorized, so that customers can easily find the dishes
 they are looking for. The categories should be clear and concise, and they should be
 consistent throughout the menu.
